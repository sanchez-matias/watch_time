# Watch Time

An outstanding movies app and my first big project on Flutter. You can search into a database with millions of movies and series to get info about them and build a watchlist to remember what to watch.

## Origin

This app has been started on a Flutter course but I could customize and add more features to it with the objective of making it a project of my own.

You can access to the original project in the following link [https://github.com/Klerith/flutter-cinemapedia/tree/fin-seccion-17](https://github.com/Klerith/flutter-cinemapedia/tree/fin-seccion-17).


## Dev

1. Go to TheMovieDB and generate your own API key.
2. Copy .env.template file and change its name to .env
3. Change the enviroment variable (TheMovieDB) with your API key.

### Isar
